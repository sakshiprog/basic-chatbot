# basic-chatbot
This project involves creating a basic chatbot using Python. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user inputs by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to build a simple yet effective conversational agent capable of interacting with users in a meaningful way.
Features
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLTK for text processing and understanding.
Machine Learning: Implements a neural network model using TensorFlow to handle user queries.
Intent Recognition: Matches user inputs to predefined intents to generate appropriate responses.
Web Deployment: Deployed using Flask to interact with users in real-time.
Continuous Learning: Incorporates a feedback loop for continuous improvement based on user interactions.
